# Node Express Server API

## Description

This project is a back-end API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API is designed to handle various operations through RESTful endpoints, enabling secure and efficient data management. It interacts with a MongoDB database for data persistence and includes centralized error handling for consistent and reliable responses.

## Functionality

- RESTful API built with Express.js for managing requests and responses.
- MongoDB integration for storing and retrieving application data.
- Middleware for secure and efficient request processing.
- Centralized error handling to ensure proper error messaging.

## Technologies Used

### Back End

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: A fast web framework for building APIs with Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.

### Other Tools & Techniques

- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions.
- **ESLint**: A tool for maintaining code quality and enforcing coding standards.
- **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting across the project.
- **Nodemon**: A development tool for automatically restarting the server when changes are detected.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string).
4. Start the server using `npm run start` for production or `npm run dev` for development with hot reloading.
